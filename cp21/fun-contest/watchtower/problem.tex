The attacks of Gallic tribes on roman trade routes really start to bother Caesar. Therefore he sends you to the provinces to solve this problem for him. You get an overview of the situation and see that every route connects two outposts. As you are a brilliant roman engineer, you know that you can build watchtowers so high in any outpost, that they can fully oversee any route that connects to this outpost. Unfortunately thou, the building materials are sparse and on top of that you are lazy and want to go home.

What is the least amount of watchtowers that need to be built to fully oversee all routes?

\paragraph*{Input}

The first line contains the number of outposts $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 20$) and the number of routes $m$ ($0 \leq m \leq n(n-1)/2$). The next $m$ lines contain two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq x,y \leq n$), the outposts that are connected by this route.

\paragraph*{Output}

Print one integer, the least amount of watchtowers needed.
